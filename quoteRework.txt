-------------Quote Rework--------------

-------------Things that wood be needed 100%--------------

Remove the racism option

Quote Structure:
    - Quote ID
    - Quote Year
    - Quote Text
    - Quote Author
    - Quote Issuer (Discord ID/Discord Username)
    - Date the quote was issued on/TimeStamp for ordering

Quote Author Structure:
    - Discord ID
    - Name (this is not the discord name; the name stored for the quoted person);
    - List of Aliases (Just a list of more names this person is referred to as; this way it's possible to have multiple names for the same person)

When adding quotes or anything: ignore upper/lower case

Adding a quote:
    !addquote [Authorname or any alias for that author] [Year] [QuoteText]
        Example: !addquote inflame 2018 "This is a quote"
        Some quotes involving 2 ppl have to be slightly reworked. But these are an exception so I do not care.

    !quotelist
        Example: !quotelist
        This will list all the quotes that are currently in the database. The list will be ordered by the date they were added.
        This command has a 1% chance to print the lyrics for Dream - Mask instead of the quote list.

    !quoteList [Authorname or any alias for that author]
        Example: !quoteList "John Doe"
        This will list all the quotes that are currently in the database for the author. The list will be ordered by the date they were added.

    !quote
        Example: !quote
        This will print a random quote from the database.

    !addAuthor [Authorname] [DiscordID]
        Example: !addAuthor "John Doe" "123456789"
        This will add an author to the database.
        Authorized User only!

    !addAlias [Authorname] [Alias]
        Example: !addAlias "John Doe" "John"
        This will add an alias to the author.
        If the Alias already exists somewhere, it will not be added.
        Authorized User only!

-------------Things that wood be cool to use but not 100% necessary--------------

Whose quote is this?
    !quoteQuiz
    The bot will print a random quote and ask the user to guess who said it. There should be 4 options to choose from (with reactions).
    Only the user that issued the command will be able to answer. (at least only this one will count)
    The bot will answer whether the guess was right/wrong. If the user does not guess within 5 minutes, the bot will give away the answer and the quiz will be over.

-------------Things that wood be nice but are just an addition to the basic functionalities--------------

Being able to delete quotes/authors/aliases

maybe even being able to edit quotes?
